I am a PhD student in Statistics at the University of British Columbia, where my research focuses on developing and applying advanced probabilistic methods to challenging problems in computational chemistry and drug discovery.

My research interests span **generative models**, **uncertainty quantification**, **variational inference**, and **Bayesian optimization**, with particular applications to structure-based drug design and molecular modelling.

Previously, I completed my MSc in Statistical Science at the University of Oxford, where I worked with Garrett Morris on conditional diffusion models for structure-based drug design. I earned my BSc in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Victoria, working with Julie Zhou on statistical methodology.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between statistical theory and practical applications in drug discovery, developing methods that are both theoretically rigorous and computationally tractable for real-world molecular systems.
