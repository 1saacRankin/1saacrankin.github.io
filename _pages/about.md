I am a PhD student in Statistics at the University of British Columbia.

I previously completed an MSc in Statistical Science at the University of Oxford. My dissertation, supervised by Garrett Morris, focused on conditional diffusion models for structure-based drug design. Before that, I earned a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Victoria, where I worked with Julie Zhou on experimental design and robust estimators.

My research interests include variational inference, Bayesian optimization, and uncertainty quantification. I am particularly interested in how these tools can be used for molecular modelling and structure-based drug design.

Outside of research, I spend a lot of time on a bike or outside. I enjoy road, gravel, and mountain cycling, as well as rock climbing and disc golf.
